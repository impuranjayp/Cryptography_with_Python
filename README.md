## What is Cryptography?
It is the ractice or study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties usually called the adversaries. Cryptography derives its etymology from the Greek words kryptós meaning “hidden secret” and graphien meaning “to write”.

In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
